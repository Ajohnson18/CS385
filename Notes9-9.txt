An algorith is a squence of unambigious instructons for 
solvinng problems.
Ex. for obtaining a required output for a legitamate input 
in a finite amount of time.

1. The unambiguity requirement for each step of an algorith
cannot be compromised.
2. The range of inputs of which an algorithm works has to be
specified carefully.
3. The same algorithm can be represented in several different
ways.
4. There may exist several algorithms for solving the same
problem.
