The number of black nodes on any simple path from, but not including, a node 
down to a leaf is called the blackheight of the node.

Lemma: A redblack tree with n internal nodes has a height of
most 2lg(n+1).

Proof: induction on the height of x
Base Case: 
	height = 0 => x is a leaf
	2^bh(x) - 1 = 2^0 - 1 = 0
Inductive Hypothesis: Assume it works for any node x of positive
	height, this is x has atleast 2^bh(x) - 1 internal nodes.
Inductive Step: Internal node x with 2 children
		Height of the (child of x) < x =>
			each child has atleast 2^bh(x)-1 - 1
			internal nodes.
		Thus, the subtree rooted at x contains atleast
		(2^bh(x)-1 - 1) + (2^bh(x)-1 - 1) + 1
		= 2 * 2^bh(x)-1 - 1 = 2^bh(x) - 1
		Let H be the height of the tree.
		By property 4, at least half the nodes from the root
		to a leaf, not including the root, must be black.
