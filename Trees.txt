- A tree is a directed acyclic graph.
- A Binary Tree is a tree where each non-null node has two potentially null children.
- A BST is a binary tree where the left child is less then the parent and the right node is larger then the parent.

Height: of tree number of edges on the path from the root to the deepest leaf
-> Height of a null tree is -1
-> Height of 1 node tree is  0

Width: of the tree is the number of nodes on the level with the most nodes.

Diameter: is the number of edges on the longest path between any two nodes.

Traversals -
 1. Preorder: Root -> Left -> Right
 2. Inorder: Left -> Root -> Right
 3. Postorder: Left -> Right -> Root
